                <h2>Creating my own website</h2>
                <p>This page walks through how I set up my own website to document my projects</p>
                <h3>1. Set up a basic working page with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h3>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/projects/images/HTML_example.png" alt="html" height="150">
                <p>
                    The first step in creating my website was using HTML to set up a basic working page where I can write and add content,
                    along with using HTML functions to organise. Through the use of w3schools' website and Jake Wrights' videos, I learnt from scratch
                    how to write in HTML. The text editor I used to create and write my HTML files is Visual Studio Code.
                    <br><br>
                    Learning a new coding language was difficult at first, but through my limited experiance in a C++ coding module and looking at online URL,
                    I picked up the basics pretty quickly. I also reinforced my learning through a bit of experimentation by seeing what the webpage would
                    look like if certain edits in the code were made.
                    <br><br>
                    After learning the basic rules and format of HTML, I slowly added in content like Titles and mini-introductions. Going further, I also 
                    created a few more webpages for different types of content, such that I had a Home page, an About page and a project page and providing links
                    to the other pages on one. This allowed me to keep my content organised and made it work like a real website. However at this point,
                    my pages were still only accssible through my local computer files, only that I could use e.g. google chrome to view it
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>2. Styling with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>

                <p>
                    After creating a working webpage in HTML. A CSS text file was then used to make my web pages look nicer. This called for learning another coding format.
                    CSS allowed me to set a border for different text bodies, shift text bodies to different parts of the pages, change background colours. 
                    I could also further edit the look of the page content, such as text alignment, font type, font colour and font size. 
                    For this part, I followed Jake Wright's youtube video guide "Learn CSS in 12 minutes", while adding in my own preferences.

                <h3>3. Uploading onto Github</h3>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/projects/images/github.png" alt="Github" height="150">
                <p>
                    Now that my webpages are created, its was time to upload them onto the internet. I used github to do this, so I created a Github account
                    and new repositories, and uploaded my HTML, CSS and image files onto my Github page. 
                    Using Github is very convenient as all I had to do was to upload my files and it made it accessible from the internet and for any update to the 
                    website, I just had to upload the updated files again to replace the old ones.
                    <br><br>
                    To make the process even easier, I also download the Github desktop app and linked it to both my Github account and my VS code text editor.
                    Previously, though simple, I still had to access my computer files to drag them into my Github account website. However, the desktop app can do it for me.
                    After linking, the desktop app picks up any changes made to the website files and allows the me to push all updates onto Github with a few button clicks.
                    This made changing things and adding updates a whole lot easier and simpler.
