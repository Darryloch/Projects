                <p>This page walks through how I set up my own website to document my projects</p>
                <h3>1. Set up a basic working page with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h3>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/projects/images/HTML_example.png" alt="html" height="150">
                <p>
                    The first step in creating my website was using HTML to set up a basic working page where I can write and add content,
                    along with using HTML functions to organise. Through the use of w3schools' website and Jake Wrights' videos, I learnt from scratch
                    how to write in HTML. The text editor I used to create and write my webpages is Visual Studio Code.
                    <br><br>
                    Learning a new coding language was difficult at first, but through my limited experiance in a C++ coding module and looking at online URL,
                    I picked up the basics pretty quickly. I also reinforced my learning through a bit of experimentation by seeing what the webpage would
                    look like if certain edits in the code were made.
                    <br><br>
                    After learning the basic rules and format of HTML, I slowly added in content like Titles and mini-introductions. Going further, I also 
                    created a few more webpages for different types of content, such that I had a Home page, an About page and a project page and providing links
                    to the other pages on one. This allowed me to keep my content organised and made it work like a real website. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>2. Styling with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/projects/images/CSS_example.png" alt="CSS" height="150">
                <p>
                    The next step was using a CSS text file to make my web pages look nicer. CSS allowed me to set a border for different text bodies, 
                    shift text bodies to different parts of the pages, change background colours and further edit the look of the page content, 
                    such as text alignment, font type, font colour and font size.
