    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Since young, I have always had a unsatiable curiosity of the world around me.
        I would often find myself fiddling with toys or taking apart things to laern about them.<br>
        Learning how and why things worked has always been fun,and sometimes even apply theories into real-life applications. 
        Be it mechanical, electrical or biological, <br>the world around me is fascinating and it is my life goal to uncover its secrets.</p>
